     >>>wp.plot_mass_fractions_vs_property( 'my_output.xml', 'time', ['h1','he4'] )

You can include keywords:

    xscale='linear' or 'log'
    yscale='linear' or 'log'
    xlim=[a,b] where a and b are the range of the x axis
    ylim=[a,b] where a and b are the range of the y axis
    xlabel='some text' which is the label of the x axis
    ylabel='some text' which is the label of the y axis
